UnitedHealth Group Reports Third Quarter 2024 Results
• Revenues of $100.8 Billion Grew $8.5 Billion Year Over Year
• Consumers Served by UnitedHealthcare’s Commercial Domestic Offerings Grew 2.4
Million Year to Date
• Third Quarter Earnings of $6.51 Per Share Include Cyberattack Impacts
• Adjusted Earnings of $7.15 Per Share Include $0.12 in Business Disruption Impacts;
Exclude $0.28 Direct Response Costs
(October 15, 2024) UnitedHealth Group (NYSE: UNH) reported third quarter 2024 results reflecting
broad-based growth in the number of people served by Optum and UnitedHealthcare.
“Our continued growth, which positions us well for the coming years, is rooted in the innovative
products and responsive service of our people that are embraced each day across the full range of
health care participants,” said Andrew Witty, chief executive officer of UnitedHealth Group.
The company’s full year 2024 net earnings outlook of $15.50 to $15.75 per share reflects the South
America operations disposition activities reported in the first half of 2024 and Change Healthcare
cyberattack impacts.
The company’s adjusted net earnings outlook of $27.50 to $27.75 continues within the $27.50 to
$28.00 range established nearly a year ago, even as it absorbs an estimated $0.75 per share of
business disruption impacts for the affected Change Healthcare services, which have increased
~$0.10 per share from the estimate provided last quarter.

Revenues $100.8 billion $100.8 billion $92.4 billion $94.4 billion
Earnings from Operations $ 8.7 billion $ 9.0 billion $ 8.5 billion $ 7.7 billion
Net Margin 6.0% 6.3% 6.3% 5.8%
• Third quarter 2024 revenues grew nearly $8.5 billion to $100.8 billion, led by strong expansion
in people served at Optum and UnitedHealthcare. Third quarter earnings from operations were
$8.7 billion, including $0.3 billion in unfavorable cyberattack effects. Adjusted earnings from
operations of $9.0 billion include the Change Healthcare business disruption impacts and
exclude the cyberattack direct response costs.
• The third quarter 2024 medical care ratio was 85.2% compared to 82.3% last year. Among
factors contributing to the increase were the previously noted CMS Medicare funding
reductions, medical reserve development effects and business and member mix. The company
did not have any favorable earnings impacting medical reserve development in the quarter.
• Days claims payable of 47.4 compared to 45.2 in the second quarter of 2024 and 50.7 in the
third quarter of 2023. The increase from the second quarter 2024 was due to a return to more
normal claims submission patterns from care providers. The change from the year ago level
reflected continued impact due to the accelerated claims payment timeframes.
• The third quarter of 2024 operating cost ratio of 13.2% compares to 13.3% in the second
quarter of 2024 and 15.0% in the prior year, reflecting continued strong operating cost
efficiency.
• Cash flows from operations from the third quarter of 2024 were $14.0 billion, or 2.2 times net
income, in part reflecting the timing of cash receipts. The company returned over $9.6 billion to
shareholders through the first nine months of 2024 through dividends and share repurchases.
Return on equity of 26.3% in the quarter reflected the company’s consistent, broad-based
earnings and efficient capital structure.

2025 Medicare Advantage plans will reach 96% of eligible Medicare beneficiaries. Recently

2025 and company expectations.

various sites of care, including in-home and clinic.
• Optum Insight operating earnings were approximately $800 million and adjusted operating
earnings, which exclude direct response costs, were $1 billion. Operating earnings and
adjusted operating earnings include the $135 million of business disruption impacts compared
to $335 million in the second quarter. The revenue backlog grew by more than $1 billion over
last year, largely due to new health system partnerships.
• Optum Rx revenue growth of $5.4 billion to $34.2 billion reflects new customers served,
deepened relationships with existing clients and the expansion of its comprehensive pharmacy
services offerings, including specialty and community-based pharmacies. Adjusted scripts grew

UNITEDHEALTH GROUP
RECONCILIATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES
Use of Non-GAAP Financial Measures
Adjusted net earnings per share, adjusted earnings from operations, adjusted operating margin, adjusted net margin and adjusted revenues are non-GAAP
financial measures. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures
prepared in accordance with GAAP. Adjustments made to these measures are as follows:
Intangible Amortization: Adjusted net earnings per share excludes intangible amortization from the relevant GAAP measure. As amortization fluctuates
based on the size and timing of the Company’s acquisition activity, management believes this exclusion presents a more useful comparison of the
Company's underlying business performance and trends from period to period. While intangible assets contribute to the Company’s revenue generation, the
intangible amortization is not directly related. Therefore, the related revenues are included in adjusted earnings per share.
South American Impacts: Adjusted net earnings per share and adjusted net margin excludes the effects of various international transactions, including the
loss on sale of our Brazilian operations that was completed on February 6, 2024, the loss on our remaining South American operations being classified as
held for sale and certain other non-recurring matters impacting our South American operations. Adjusted earnings from operations, adjusted operating
margin and adjusted revenues excludes the effects of certain non-recurring matters impacting our South American operations. As these matters are related
to the Company's strategy to exit South America, the impact is not representative of the Company's underlying business performance and therefore
management believes the exclusion presents a more useful comparison of the Company's underlying business performance and trends from period to
period.
Direct Response Costs - Cyberattack: Adjusted net earnings per share, adjusted earnings from operations, adjusted operating margin and adjusted net
margin excludes cyberattack direct response costs. Management believes the exclusion of costs incurred to investigate and remediate the attack, other
direct and incremental costs incurred as a result of the cyberattack and incremental costs for accommodations to support care providers presents a more
useful comparison of the Company's and its reportable segments' underlying business performance and trends from period to period.
Note: See pages 4 and 5 for reconciliation of GAAP amounts to adjusted revenues, adjusted earnings from operations and adjusted operating margin.
