Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, or superior to, financial measures\nprepared in accordance with GAAP. Adjustments made to these measures are as follows:\nIntangible Amortization: Adjusted net earnings per share excludes intangible amortization from the relevant GAAP measure. As amortization fluctuates\nbased on the size and timing of the Company’s acquisition activity, management believes this exclusion presents a more useful comparison of the\nCompany's underlying business performance and trends from period to period. While intangible assets contribute to the Company’s revenue generation, the\nintangible amortization is not directly related. Therefore, the related revenues are included in adjusted earnings per share.\nSouth American Impacts: Adjusted net earnings per share and adjusted net margin excludes the effects of various international transactions, including the\nloss on sale of our Brazilian operations that was completed on February 6, 2024, the loss on our remaining South American operations being classified as\nheld for sale and certain other non-recurring matters impacting\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o-mini", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_56d2ad2f47159d6bba5fea097711e1ce30f58f3d758cea1e1b445928282d8590_v2"}
