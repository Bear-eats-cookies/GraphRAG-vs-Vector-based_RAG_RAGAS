This adjustment reflected a positive impact on operational efficiency, where the operating cost ratio improved to 13.2%, compared to 13.3% in the previous quarter and 15.0% a year prior. 

The change in claims processing likely contributed to strengthened cash flow management, with cash flows from operations reaching $14.0 billion, which was 2.2 times the net income. This robust cash flow was partially a result of favorable timing in cash receipts, enhancing the company’s liquidity and ability to return value to shareholders, amounting to over $9.6 billion distributed through dividends and share repurchases during the first nine months of 2024.

This operational efficiency and favorable cash flow dynamics ultimately played a significant role in the company's return on equity (ROE), as increased efficiency in claims processing and cash management would enhance profitability and shareholder returns.","In Q3 2024, UnitedHealth Group's days claims payable increased to 47.4 from 45.2 in Q2, due to changes in claims submission patterns and accelerated payment timeframes. This increase supported care providers but reduced cash flows from operations to $7.6 billion. The return on equity was stable at 24.5%, reflecting operational efficiency despite higher claim payouts.",0.48901345879179736,0.7146745248223617,,0.5882352941176471

### Revenue Changes from 2023 to 2024 (in millions):
- **Total Revenues:**
  - **2024:** $74,853 (Optum) + $63,925 (UnitedHealthcare) = $100,820
  - **2023:** $69,853 (Optum) + $56,737 (UnitedHealthcare) = $92,361
  - **Change:** $100,820 - $92,361 = **+$8,459 million**

- **Optum Segments:**
  - **UnitedHealthcare:**
    - **2024:** $25,917
    - **2023:** $23,864
    - **Change:** +$2,053 million
  - **Health Services:**
    - **2024:** $4,931
    - **2023:** $4,977
    - **Change:** -$46 million
  - **OptumRx:**
    - **2024:** $34,207
    - **2023:** $28,857
    - **Change:** +$5,350 million

Thus, we see an increase in total revenues from 2023 to 2024, with notable growth in the UnitedHealthcare and OptumRx segments.

### Impact of Cyberattack:
The document indicates the following impacts of a cyberattack on revenues:
- **Business disruption impacts - cyberattack in 2024:** Total of $134 million.
- **Direct response costs for nine months in 2024:** $341 million for Optum and $1,710 million for UnitedHealth.
- **Tax effect of direct response costs:** $80 million for Optum and $403 million for UnitedHealth.
- An estimated **$0.75 per share** of business disruption impacts was reported for the affected Change Healthcare services.

Overall, while revenue grew in most segments, the cyberattack did have significant financial impacts in the form of direct response costs and additional disruption impacts impacting net earnings.","From 2023 to 2024, UnitedHealth Group's revenues grew by 8% to $400.3 billion, with UnitedHealthcare increasing due to Medicare Advantage growth and Optum Health growing from value-based care.

Key contributors included the disposition activities related to their South America operations, as well as the impacts from a cyberattack on Change Healthcare, which notably affected their services. 

As a result of these factors, UnitedHealth's net earnings attributable to common shareholders showed a significant change, with net earnings for 2024 projected between $15.50 and $15.75 per share, despite the noted disruptions. In comparison, the full year 2023 figures were substantially higher, with diluted earnings per share reported at $18.01.

The adjusted earnings per share outlook for 2024 remained within the previously established range of $27.50 to $27.75, even amid an estimated disruption impact of $0.75 per share due to the Change Healthcare incident.

In summary, from 2023 to 2024, UnitedHealth Group faced challenges that affected their revenues and net earnings, leading to a projected decrease in earnings per share for common shareholders, although their adjusted earnings per share outlook indicated some resilience.","From 2023 to 2024, UnitedHealth Group's revenues increased by 8% to $400.3 billion due to higher premiums and service expansions. Net earnings dropped to $14.4 billion from $22 billion, impacted by a $7 billion South American loss and $1.90-$2.05 per share cyberattack costs. Earnings per share rose 8% to $15.50-$15.75 due to share repurchasing.",0.438321995201165,0.8532879808046601,,1.0
